📘 Chapter 1: Introduction to Algorithms

This chapter introduces the concept of algorithms and how their performance is measured using Big O notation.

🧩 Key Concepts

Algorithm: A set of steps to solve a problem.

Linear Search (O(n)): Checks each element one by one until it finds the target.

Example: Drawing 16 boxes and checking each box — time grows linearly with the number of items.

Binary Search (O(log n)): Works on sorted data by repeatedly dividing the list in half until the target is found.

Example: Folding a paper in half — the problem size shrinks quickly each step.

Big O Notation: Describes how an algorithm’s running time grows as input size increases.

⚡ Comparison
Algorithm	Description	Big O	Example
Linear Search	Check every element	O(n)	Drawing boxes
Binary Search	Divide and conquer	O(log n)	Folding paper
💡 Takeaway

Efficient algorithms matter — O(log n) grows much slower than O(n), making a huge difference as data size increases.
